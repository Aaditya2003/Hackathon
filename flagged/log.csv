The top 5 most probable fatal diseases for the patient are:

1. Metabolic Syndrome - that can lead to an array of serious life-threatening conditions
2. Cardiovascular disease - which could lead to heart attack or stroke.
3. Cancer progression - the cancer could advance and become fatal. 
4. Kidney disease - some cancer treatments can damage the kidneys
5. Stroke - occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced.

The top 5 possible allergies to medications in future for the patient are:

1. Chemotherapy drugs (used to treat cancer)
2. Antibiotics (used to treat infections)
3. Pain medications (used to manage cancer pain)
4. Anti-nausea medications (used to manage side-effects of cancer treatment)
5. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (used to reduce inflammation and pain)

The top 5 Lab tests that should be done for prevention and early diagnosis of diseases for the patient based on past problems are:

1. Pulmonary function tests (to monitor asthma)
2. Lipid profile (to monitor cholesterol and triglycerides levels)
3. Blood glucose level monitoring (to monitor diabetes)
4. Kidney function tests (to monitor kidney disease)
5. Complete blood count (CBC) and tumor markers (to monitor cancer progression)

The top 5 most probable illnesses with percent chance for the patient based on current symptoms and lab results are:

1. Cancer progression - 60%
2. Late-Onset Diabetes - 30%
3. Hypertension  - 5%
4. Stroke - 2%
5. Asthma exacerbation - 2%

The top 5 vaccines for diseases currently spreading for the patient are:

1. Influenza vaccine (yearly)
2. Pneumococcal vaccine (one-time)
3. Tdap vaccine (every 10 years)
4. COVID-19 vaccine (if not already vaccinated)
5. HPV vaccine (if not already vaccinated)

The top 5 cancer treatments that may be prescribed for the patient are:

1. Surgery- to remove the cancerous tissue 
2. Chemotherapy- to destroy cancer cells 
3. Radiation therapy- to damage the DNA of the cancer cells 
4. Immunotherapy- to boost the immune system to fight cancer cells 
5. Targeted therapy- to target specific cancer cells 

The likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital after being discharged depends on several factors such as their medical history, current diagnosis, access to follow-up care, and compliance with treatment plans. Additional information is required to make an accurate prediction.",,,2023-04-16 00:03:09.901447
